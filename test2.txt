2. Now, we have 2 special kinds of birds: the Duck and the Chicken... Can you
implement them to make their own special sound?
a. A duck says: “Quack, quack”
b. A duck can swim
c. A chicken says: “Cluck, cluck”
d. A chicken cannot fly (assumption: its wings are clipped but ignore that)


[Ramya] : 
class Animal {
 void walk(){
 System.out.println("I am walking");
 }
}
abstract class Bird extends Animal {
 void fly() {
 System.out.println("I am flying");
 }
 abstract void sing();
 void swim() {
 System.out.println("I am swimming");
 }
}
class Chicken extends Bird {
 void sing(){
 System.out.println("cluck cluck");
 }
 void fly(){
 System.out.println("I cannot fly");
 }
}
class Duck extends Bird {
 void sing(){
 System.out.println("quack quack");
 }
 void swim(){
 System.out.println("I can swim");
 }
}
public class Solution {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  Chicken chick = new Chicken();
  chick.sing();
  chick.fly();
  Duck duck = new Duck();
  duck.sing();
  duck.swim();
 }
}

Result :

cluck cluck

I cannot fly

quack quack

I can swim
